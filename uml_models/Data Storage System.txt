Data Storage:
The DataStorage class is responsible for storing all patient data, including real-time vital signs and historical medical records. Given the sensitive nature of this information, the data is transmitted and stored using secure, encrypted channels. This ensures patient confidentiality and complies with data protection regulations like HIPAA in the United States or GDPR in Europe.
Patient Data:
PatientData represents the individual patient records. This class might include fields like patient ID, name, medical history, diagnosis, treatments, and other relevant clinical information. PatientData is central to trend analysis, allowing healthcare professionals to track a patient's progress over time, predict health trends, and respond to emergencies.
Data Retriever:
The DataRetriever class provides the interface through which medical staff can access patient data. It includes mechanisms for querying and fetching specific information, but only after rigorous security checks. These checks ensure that only authorized personnel, such as doctors, nurses, or authorized administrative staff, can access patient data. Authorization might involve user roles, passwords, biometric authentication, or multi-factor authentication.
Operations:
Data handling operations in this system involve secure storage, authorized retrieval, and proper deletion. Storage is designed to be resilient to data breaches, with encryption both in transit and at rest. Retrieval is controlled to prevent unauthorized access, and deletion policies ensure that patient data is not retained longer than necessary, respecting patient privacy and regulatory requirements.
Privacy and Security:
Privacy and security are key concerns in this system. The DataStorage must ensure that only personnel with a legitimate medical need can access patient data, and logs should be kept to track who accessed what data and when. The system should also allow for the complete and secure deletion of patient records when required, either due to patient request, legal requirements, or end of retention periods.
