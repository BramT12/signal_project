The Data Access Layer start with the DataListener. Every possible type of data first gets received here before being forwarded for decryption in one of the three translation classes: FileDataListener, TCPDataListener and WebSocketDataListener. If the data does not match any of these 3 classes, it will get rejected. After being received by one of the 3 mentioned classes the data will subsequently be analyzed and translated to be in a usable format. When this has happened the data will now be forwarded towards the DataParsers who in turn standardizes the received transcript so that each type of translation is unified. In case the DataParser is unable to do this will send an alert to the AlertGenerator who triggers a system alert to stop unidentifiable data from entering the system. If everything goes right int the DataParser, the data will be given to the DataSourceAdapter who processes and then stores what he receives.
