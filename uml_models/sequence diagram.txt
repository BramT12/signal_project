As soon as the Alert Generator receives abnormal data which has passed a certain threshold it goes on to check the history of the patient in the Data Storage to monitor the flow of the data. After continuously receiving the history from the storage the alert generator evaluates the need for an alert. If necessary it then triggers an alert on the monitors of the hospital to get the attention of the staff. The staff then checks the alert which notifies the Alert Generator that the problem is being looked at and requires no new alerts. In case the problem does not resolve itself automatically the nurses administer treatment to stabilize the patients abnormal readings. This treatment changes the data readings on the Patient Data Machine which gives the Alert Generator new data to evaluate. If the new readings show a positive trend the generator marks the problem as solved. If the new readings don’t appear promising the Alert Generator creates a new alert after some time.
