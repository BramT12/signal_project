The Patient Identification System starts with the PatientIdentifier. When new data about a patient arrives, this class is where the data first gets received. The PatientIdentifier class then uses the PatientID belonging to this data to match it with a patient record in the PatientRecord archive. If a match has been found the existing data can then also be retrieved from the archive if necessary. If no match is found the PatientIdentifier class will then signal the creation of a new patient record. To account for discrepancies, the IdentityManager now comes into play. A discrepancy may happen when new data belonging to an existing patient contradicts the data of this patient in the archive. If it does the class’s method returns a Boolean and initiates the alertGenerator method which in turn sends a signal to the AlertGenerator. This will then trigger an alert so that the system notices something has gone wrong. Lastly, after the check in the IdentityManager has been completed, the PatientRecord class either stores, deletes or retrieves the new data.
