Generated:
An Alert is created when a monitoring system detects a condition that triggers an alert threshold. This condition could be a vital sign exceeding a predefined limit (like heart rate or blood pressure), an equipment malfunction, or another critical event. Once the condition is detected, an Alert object is instantiated, marking the beginning of its lifecycle.
Sent:
After an Alert is generated, it is sent to the relevant recipients. This involves the system notifying medical staff through mobile devices, workstations, or other communication channels. The transition from "Generated" to "Sent" is automatic, typically handled by an AlertManager or similar coordinating component.
Acknowledged:
When medical staff receive the alert, they need to acknowledge it to confirm they have seen and are acting on it. This transition from "Sent" to "Acknowledged" requires user action, such as pressing an acknowledgment button or responding via an application. Acknowledgment helps prevent alert fatigue by indicating that the alert is being addressed.
Resolved:
An Alert is resolved when the underlying issue has been addressed. This could be a successful intervention by medical staff (e.g., administering medication or adjusting a device), indicating that the critical condition no longer exists. The transition from "Acknowledged" to "Resolved" is also driven by user action, typically by a medical professional confirming that the alert has been handled.
Transitions between these states can involve additional actions, such as re-sending alerts if they are not acknowledged within a specific timeframe, or escalating alerts to higher-level staff if immediate attention is required.

Throughout the lifecycle, the system should maintain a clear audit trail, logging the creation, sending, acknowledgment, and resolution of each alert. This record is crucial for analyzing response times, identifying trends in alert causes, and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations.
